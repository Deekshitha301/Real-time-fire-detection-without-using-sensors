## Features
- Real-time fire detection using the HSV color space and Haar classifiers.
- Audible alarms and SMS alerts upon detection.
- Implements computer vision techniques with OpenCV.
- Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with Pygame.
- Tested under various lighting conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision.
  - Pygame: For GUI and sound alerts.
  - NumPy: For numerical computations.
- **IDE**: PyCharm
